## Process

You can enter your location and destination. Minecraft uses three digits of precision in X and Z coordinates.

The checkboxes convert [Overworld](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Overworld) coordinates to [the Nether](https://minecraft.wiki/w/The_Nether) coordinates.

## About

Just a normal slope calculator which calculates two Minecraft coordinates. One has only to enter the X and Z coords for this to work. 

Used Maven and Spring Boot for this.

I really should thank the coding folks on the Bentovid Discord server for making my static code better. Tbh, it would've been a nightmare without their contributions.

I wanted it to be a Minecraft plugin, but it wasn't successful, since we play on Aternos and that hosting service only accepts the plugins which have gained a bit of popularity. Therefore, I lost all motivation. I had the Java method with me though, so I thought of making a Spring Boot application based on that.

Regardless, [please check out at its GitHub repo](https://github.com/FlyingSaturn/yaw-calculator).
