Just a normal slope calculator which calculates two Minecraft coordinates. One has to only enter the X and Z coords for this to work. 

Used Maven.

`index.html` should be hosted from localhost:8000 
and spring-boot should run from port 8080
(which is the default one for spring-boot, so you don't need to worry about that)

Use `mvn spring-boot:run` to run the app.

I really should thank the coding folks on the Bentovid Discord server for making my static code better. Tbh, it would've been a nightmare without their contributions.
