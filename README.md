Just a normal slope calculator which calculates two Minecraft coordinates. One has to only enter the X and Z coords for this to work. 

Used Maven:
com.example.demo is the package of this whole thing

index.html will be out of the whole system. 

index.html should be hosted from localhost:8000 
and spring-boot should run from port 8080 
(the default one, so you don't need to worry about the latter)

use 
`mvn spring-boot:run` 
to run the app.
